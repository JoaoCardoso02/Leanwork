# Welcome to LeadContactManager!

Hello, this is a contact manager!
First, I was challenged by two pages created! Where number one is a data log page and the second is a view of the data.
But, I went beyond!
I created three pages, with some functions:
+ **Registration**
	+ Here, it's a user registration page;
+ **Login**
    + Here, it's a user login page;
+ **Main**
	+ Here, we have some functions:
		+ User:
			+ View personal data;
			+ Alter personal data;
			+ Delete your user;
			+ Alter password;
			+ Log Off.
		+ Contact:
			+ View personal contacts;
			+ Alter personal contacts;
			+ Delete your contacts;
			+ Create new contacts.
